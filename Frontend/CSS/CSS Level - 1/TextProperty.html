        Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by
        Marvel Comics. Co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter
        Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby, the character
        first appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 in 1963, and received his own title 
        with Iron Man #1 in 1968. Shortly after his creation, Iron Man was a founding 
        member of a superhero team, the Avengers, with Thor, Ant-Man, Wasp and the Hulk.

      <h3>Premiere</h3>
      <p>
        Following the success of the Fantastic Four in 1961 and the subsequent revival of 
        superhero comic books, Marvel set about creating new superhero characters.
        During this time, Stan Lee developed the initial concept for Iron Man.
        Lee was interested in making an unlikeable character likeable, saying that 
        he "thought it would be fun to take the kind of character that nobody would like, 
        none of [Marvel's] readers would like, and shove him down their throats and make 
        them like him".

      <h3>Solo series</h3>
      <p>
        Previously relegated to short stories in an anthology series, Iron Man was one 
        of several characters to receive a full-length dedicated series in 1968. 
        The final issues of Tales of Suspense and Sub-Mariner's Tales to Astonish were 
        combined as a one-shot special, Iron Man and Sub-Mariner.Iron Man then began 
        its run under writer Archie Goodwin.Political themes were reintroduced slowly 
        over the following years, with a focus on domestic issues like racial conflict 
        and environmentalism rather than geopolitics.
