/* ---> If, for instance, the div element were inside a body element whose font-size 
        was also specified in ems, that value would become a part of the equation too. 
        This is the compounding effect. You could maybe think of it like a snowball effect. 
        The font-sizes snowball on top of each other and create an end-result that might be much 
        different than you want. */
